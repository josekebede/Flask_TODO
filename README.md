# Flask_TODO
To-Do
•	Built a responsive Single Page Application using Flask that allowed users to keep track of errands or tasks that need to be done.

•	Users would be able to enter the tasks that they need to do. They have the ability to make changes to the tasks. Once they are done
with their tasks they can also remove them from the list.

•	Leveraged SQLAlchemy, a Python SQL toolkit for database implementation and Jinja2 as a template engine, as well as HTML and CSS to 
structure the content of the web page and provide a style, respectively.
